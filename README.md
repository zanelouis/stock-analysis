# Stock-Analysis

## Overview
We want to help Steve gather some information regarding specific stock performance. We know that if we can setup some basic programming language, Steve will be able to provide precise and accurate information in a click of a button and make changes and different analysis with this code in minutes. 

## Summary
We were able to obtain two tables of data for stocks in 2017 and 2018. From here we can calculate the yearly return and average volume of transactions for investment performance by analyzing all of the stocks.

## Challenge
We can write VBA code to assist with this task. A subroutine is what we would want to create first which acts as a series of steps or instructions that run in the Visual Basic Editor of Microsoft Excel. We can create analysis in the programming language to improve performance time and efficiency.
Further, we can set a timer to measure how efficient our code really is and have MacroChecks to ensure all of our code is debugged and flowing correctly. If we need to change our analysis at any given moment, one can easily manipulate the code to make changes in the data that is outputted. We can use VBA to delete, clear or create new worksheets for data to be positioned. Moreover, we can add normal and/or conditional formatting to our worksheets.
